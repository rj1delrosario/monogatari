This is a personal blog about life in Japan. Most of the articles will be from my experiences living in Japan, although some topics maybe related to life in general.

## About Me

- came to Japan in the early 2000s using an engineer visa 
- been working as an embedded systems (firmware) engineer
- living with my family (all non-Japanese, permanent visa holders)
- proud owner of a house since 2015  
(Technically speaking the bank currently owns the house, but I pay for the property taxes)

Thanks!
