Nippon Individual Savings Account or NISA is a small-amount investment tax saving scheme. Normally, income from dividends and capital gains in equities or trust funds are taxed at a flat rate of 20 percent (15 percent national tax and 5 percent inhabitant tax). By using NISA, individuals (foreigners included) can take advantage of the tax exemption for investments involving small contributions within a specified period.

## Types of NISA

There are 3 types of NISA: Ordinary NISA, Tsumitate NISA, and Junior NISA. Each has a different target investor, but all can be an effective tool for personal asset formation.

### Ordinary NISA (<ruby><rb>一般</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>いっぱん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>NISA)

This is the first type of NISA launched in 2014 for residents 20 years old and above. Using this account, investments with a limit of 1.2 million yen (¥1,200,000) per year for 5 years are tax exempted.

This account is for individuals who are comfortable selecting from a wide range of financial products (including American stocks), and those who wish to freely decide when and how much to invest.

### Tsumitate NISA (つみたてNISA)

Tsumitate NISA (also known as "Dollar-Cost Averaging NISA" or "Installment-type NISA") is designed to promote small and diversified investments for long term asset accumulation. This type of NISA is for individuals who want to invest a fixed amount periodically.

It was launched in 2018 and, like Ordinary NISA, is also for 20 years old and above. In comparison, Tsumitate NISA has a lower annual contribution limit of 0.4 million yen (¥400,000) but a longer tax exemption period of 20 years. The selection of financial products is also limited in Tsumitate NISA.

### Junior NISA (ジュニアNISA)

This type of NISA is for residents under the age of 20 (0 to 19 years old). It was launched in 2016 and the purpose is to transfer part of financial assets held by the elderly to the younger generations. The maximum annual tax-free investment is 0.8 million yen (¥800,000) for 5 years.

Although the account is for minors, investments are managed by a person with parental authority (parent or guardian). The funds (which will mostly come from relatives) used to buy financial products are covered by the annual basic exemption on donation tax.

The nice thing about Junior NISA is that even after the investment period ends, the income from the investments is tax-free [until the minor turns 20](https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/nisa2/about/junior/point/index.html) years old. However, the withdrawal of funds is not allowed before the account holder turns 18 years old.

## One account per person

You need to open one applicable tax-exempt account (Ordinary NISA, Tsumitate NISA, or Junior NISA). These accounts are offered by banks and security firms in Japan. Banks only offer stock investment trust while security firms also offer other financial products like listed stocks, ETFs, REITs, etc.

For Ordinary NISA and Junior NISA, you can open an account until the year 2023. Investments made in the year 2023 are eligible for tax exemption until the year 2027 (5 year period).

For Tsumitate NISA, you have until the year 2037 to open an account. Investments for the year 2037 will be not be levied tax until the year 2056 (20 years).

## Statistics

As of September 2019 ([announced in December 2019](https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/nisa/20191220/01.pdf)), there are a total of 13,750,063 NISA accounts.

| NISA Type      | Number of Accounts |
| :------------- | -----------------: |
| Ordinary NISA  |         11,701,321 |
| Tsumitate NISA |          1,705,900 |
| Junior NISA    |            342,842 |
| *Total*        |       *13,750,063* |

Considering the population [estimates](https://www.stat.go.jp/data/jinsui/pdf/202002.pdf) in Japan for September 2019 is about 126.131 million, a mere 11% of all residents are using this tax-privileged investment system. Specifically, about 13% of the 105 million adults own Ordinary and Tsumitate NISA accounts, and only 2% of the 21 million minors own Junior NISA account.

## My Experience

I use [SBI Securities (SBI<ruby><rb>証券</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しょうけん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>)](https://www.sbisec.co.jp/) for my family's NISA accounts. The application forms and their website are all in Japanese. Even the financial products that they offer contains no English information.

An individual who wishes to open a NISA account using SBI Securities needs to create an SBI Securities account first. During the process, you may specify if you wish to open an Ordinary NISA or Tsumitate NISA. For Junior NISA, the minor needs a separate SBI Securities account.

Applications need to be approved by the tax office and it may take a few weeks to process. When the application is approved, you will receive a confirmation by postal mail together with some information to access your account online.

You need to fund your SBI Securities account before you start to buy any financial products. SBI Securities offer free fund transfer from Japan Post Bank (ゆうちょダイレクト) among others.

For more information about using SBI Securities for NISA, just use the NISA menu on SBI Securities website.

## Recent (2020) updates

You may have noticed that you can only open Ordinary NISA until 2023. So what happens after 2023? The ["2020 Tax Reform Proposals"](https://www.fsa.go.jp/news/r1/sonota/zeikaitaiko01.pdf) show some changes to NISA from the year 2024.

### Changes to Ordinary NISA

Opening an Ordinary NISA account will be extended for another 5 years (2024 to 2028). From 2024, it will be revised to a two-level system, where the second level can be used only after an investment is made on the first level. The first level will be the same as Tsumitate NISA, while the second level is like the current Ordinary NISA but excluding financial products not suitable for stable asset formation.

### Changes to Tsumitate NISA

As with Ordinary NISA, Tsumitate NISA will also be extended by 5 years (previously until 2037 but will be until 2042).

### Changes to Junior NISA

The period of opening a new Junior NISA account will not be extended, so it will end in 2023. The reason it seems, as the statistics show, is because it is less popular than the two other NISA.

Also, restrictions regarding the withdrawal of funds will be [removed](https://www.mof.go.jp/tax_policy/tax_reform/outline/fy2020/20191220taikou.pdf) from January 2024. That means selling and withdrawing the proceeds of investments even before the account holder becomes 18 will be allowed and no longer be taxed.

## Final thoughts

I was hoping that they just remove the deadline for opening accounts, and perhaps allow reinvestments. The new changes will make it more complicated, and it is clear that the government is still in the process experimentation. Still, having the Ordinary NISA extended, even just for another 5 years, is very much welcome. And although Junior NISA will end by 2023, there are 4 more years to invest. That is still 3.2 million yen of tax-free investment.
