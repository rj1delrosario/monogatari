For those who want to know what Narita Airport looks like during the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to the following pictures taken today May 11, 2020 (Monday) at Narita Airport Terminal 2. As expected, most flights are canceled.

It was still early in the morning, but I don't think the view will change that much because of limited flights. Below is a view of the check-in counters.

And below is from the other side.
