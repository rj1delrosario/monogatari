There is something about miso soup that makes a meal so satisfying. Although the taste and aroma of a miso soup can be complex, the soup itself is easy to prepare. To make the soup, you need dashi (soup stock), miso (fermented soybean paste), and additional ingredients depending on what your taste buds fantasize.

## Dashi

Dashi (出汁, だし) is typically made by simmering or boiling a natural ingredient to make the stock. This natural ingredient can be dried bonito flakes to make *katsuo dashi* (かつおだし),  seaweed (kelp) to make *konbu dashi* (昆布だし), dried baby sardines to make *niboshi dashi* (煮干しだし), among others.

Dashi is an essential element in Japanese cuisine that is also used to make other soups (including udon, soba, and nabe), sukiyaki, gyudon, and [so much more](https://park.ajinomoto.co.jp/recipe/search/?search_word=「ほんだし」) (link is a Japanese site).

At home, we use an instant dashi product from Ajinomoto called hondashi (ほんだし). This granule type dashi is dissolved in water to make the soup stock. Very easy to use.

## Miso

Miso (味噌, みそ) is made through fermentation using soybeans, salt, and a fermenting agent [koji (麹)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae). The fermenting agent used will determine the type of miso --- rice for *kome miso* (米味噌), barley for *mugi miso* (麦味噌), and soybean for *mame miso* (豆味噌). Based on Japan Federation of Miso Manufacturers Cooperatives, 80% of what is produced in Japan is kome miso.

Although miso soup may be the most popular dish using miso, there are many other foods in Japan that use this ingredient. The internet contains literally thousands of recipes using it (miso.or.jp currently shows 1095 recipes).

You can read more about miso from an English pamphlet published by Japan Federation of Miso Manufacturers Cooperatives at miso.or.jp by searching [*the world of miso*](https://www.google.com/search?q=world+of+miso).

You may notice a diverse range of miso products when you go to a Japanese supermarket, some with dashi already included (だし入り).

## Additional ingredients for toppings

Other than the basic dashi and miso, you can add various toppings to supplement the texture and flavor of the soup. Classic ingredients include wakame (seaweed), tofu, green onions, mushrooms, and Japanese leeks. Perhaps any vegetable that you can find from the fridge can be added...OK, maybe not.

There is also a variation where you use pork in addition to vegetables. Once you put pork in it, the soup will no longer be miso shiru but *tonjiru* or *butajiru* ([とん汁, 豚汁](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=tonjiru)).

## Making the soup

If you are in a hurry or you don't feel like cooking, using instant miso soup maybe your best option. But if you want to control how salty you want the soup to taste, or you want to try different variations of ingredients then cooking is the way to go.

There's more than one way to cook, and if you normally cook, then you can't go wrong with this versatile soup.
Using dried wakame, you can make a delicious miso soup for under 5 minutes.

1. Prepare the ingredients.
    - You may need to wash your dried wakame, so check the label.
    - Check the amount of dashi granules and miso paste that you need to use depending on the amount of soup you want to make.
2. Dissolve the instant dashi in a pot of water then turn on the heat.  
Wait until it starts to simmer.
3. When the soup stock starts to bubble, dissolve the miso paste into it.
4. Add the remaining ingredients (for example, wakame).  
Wait until it starts to simmer.  
Taste the soup to check if you need to make adjustments. Adding dashi will make it saltier.
5. When the miso soup starts to bubble, turn off the heat.

Don't let the soup boil after adding the miso paste otherwise it may lose its taste.
