If you are a homeowner in Japan and you purchased or made improvements to a house with a home loan, you can reduce your taxes for 10 years  (*NOTE*: a 3-year extension was introduced in 2019)  using a tax break program called [home loan tax deduction](https://www.mlit.go.jp/jutakukentiku/house/jutakukentiku_house_tk2_000017.html).

## Requirements

The following are the main [requirements](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/shotoku/1213.htm) before you can apply for a home loan tax deduction.

- home loan period for 10 years or more
- the house (which the loan was applied for) is used for residence within 6 months from the date of construction or acquisition
- total amount of your income for the year of the deduction is 30 million yen or less
- the floor area of the house is 50 square meters or more

I'm pretty sure a normal salaried worker (サラリーマン) building a normal house will meet those requirements.

## Application

To receive the deduction for the home loan, you need to file a tax return. You must apply for the deduction personally for the first year, but for the following years you can use the year-end tax adjustment (<ruby><rb>年末調整</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ねんまつちょうせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) if you are a company employee.

### First year

You need to prepare the following documents for the first year of application.

5. <ruby><rb>源泉徴収票</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>げんせんちょうしゅうひょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

#### 1. 確定申告書

![確定申告書A ](/public/image/home-loan-shinkokushoA.png)

#### 2. (特定増改築等) 住宅借入金等特別控除額の計算明細書

![住宅借入金等特別控除額の計算明細書](/public/image/home-loan-keisanshoumeisho.png)

Both 確定申告書 and 計算明細書 can be downloaded as a PDF file from [National Tax Agency website](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/shinkoku/yoshiki/01/shinkokusho/02.htm). You can also get it from the tax office and the people there will also help you fill in the necessary information (that's what we did a few years ago).

#### 3. 登記事項証明書、 売買契約書

These are the [certificate of registration](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/登記事項証明書) and contract for the purchase of the properties. These documents show when the properties (<ruby><rb>建物</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>たてもの</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, <ruby><rb>土地</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>とち</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) are acquired, for how much, and the floor area. If purchased separately, then you need both the documents for the house and the land. 
You can get the certificate of registration from your nearest <ruby><rb>法務局</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ほうむきょく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>サービスセンター (or online) for a fee, while you only need to submit a copy of the purchase contracts.

#### 4. 住宅取得資金に係る借入金の年末残高等証明書

About the size of a postcard, this document is sent from the financial institution where you got your home loan. It shows the contents of the home loan ー who made the loan, the purpose (for house, land, or both), the year-end balance, the duration, etc.

![住宅取得資金に係る借入金の年末残高等証明書](/public/image/home-loan-balance.png)

#### 5. 源泉徴収票

This is the *Income Tax Withholding Slip* issued by your employer every year.

#### How to fill up the forms

Refer to the example document from the [National Tax Agency website](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/shinkoku/tebiki/2018/pdf/006.pdf).

### Second year and onwards

Starting from the second year, the application will be much easier. There are only two types of documents required to apply for the deduction.

1. <ruby><rb>住宅</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>じゅうたく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>取得</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しゅとく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>資金</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しきん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>に<ruby><rb>係</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>かか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>る<ruby><rb>借入金</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>かりいれきん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby><rb>年末</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ねんまつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>残高</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ざんだか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>等</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>とう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>証明書</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しょうめいしょ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
2. <ruby><rb>給与所得者</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>きゅうよしょとくしゃ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の (特定増改築等)<ruby><rb>住宅</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>じゅうたく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>借入金</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>かりいれきん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>等</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>とう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>特別</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>とくべつ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>控除</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>こうじょ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>申告書</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しんこくしょ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

#### 1. 住宅取得資金に係る借入金の年末残高等証明書

Remember the postcard size document containing your home loan year-end balance? Yes, you will receive it every year. You need to refer to this document for the remaining balance when you fill the form below. You will also need to submit this document together with the form.

#### 2. 給与所得者の(特定増改築等)住宅借入金等特別控除申告書

You will receive a total of 9 pieces of this form through postal mail from the tax office. These are very important documents that you will be using for 9 years and I suggest that you keep them safe. If lost, then refer to the [National Tax Agency website](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/tetsuzuki/shinsei/annai/shinkoku/annai/36.htm) on how to apply for re-issuance.

![住宅借入金等特別控除申告書](/public/image/home-loan-tokubetsukoujo-shinkokusho.png)

The information on the lower part of the document is pre-printed, and you only need to fill the upper part.

Notice that there are markers, circled number (①) or letter (Ⓐ), in the document for easy reference.

![Marks on 住宅借入金等特別控除申告書](/public/image/home-loan-shinkokusho_marks.png)

For example, here is how we (with a loan made for both the house and the land) fill them up.

| Row  | Column | Contents                                                     |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ①    | Ⓒ      | Home loan remaining balance. Refer to 年末残高等証明書.      |
| ②    | Ⓐ      | Purchase price for the house. Refer to ㋺ on the lower part of the document. |
| ②    | Ⓑ      | Purchase price for the land. Refer to ㋭ on the lower part of the document. |
| ②    | Ⓒ      | Sum of ㋺ and ㋭.                                            |
| ③    | Ⓐ      | Refer to ㋥ and ㋩ on the lower part of the document.        |
| ③    | Ⓑ      | Refer to ㋣ and ㋬ on the lower part of the document.        |
| ③    | Ⓒ      | Part of the property used for residential purposes. Normally 100%. |
| ④    | Ⓒ      | The smaller amount between ①Ⓒ and ②Ⓒ. The same with ①Ⓒ in my case. |
| ⑤    | Ⓒ      | ④Ⓒ multiplied to ③Ⓒ. The same with ①Ⓒ in my case.            |
| ⑪    |        | ⑤Ⓒ multiplied to ⑩. The same with ①Ⓒ in my case.             |
| ⑭    |        | ⑪ multiplied to 1%                                           |

And don't forget to write the estimate of your annual after-tax income in space for <ruby><rb>年間</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ねんかん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>所得</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しょとく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby><rb>見積</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>みつもり</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>額</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>がく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

Since most of the information is the same every year, except for the loan's year-end balance and the resulting tax deduction (which can be easily computed from the year-end balance anyway), some companies  (like my employer) offer a system to efficiently apply for the deduction. Currently, I no longer manually write anything in the form and I only need to input the year-end balance using an automated system. I still need to submit the documents (form and the proof of year-end balance), but not having to write anything is very much welcome.
