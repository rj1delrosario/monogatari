As financial assistance during the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis, the Japanese government is distributing special cash payments of 100,000 yen for every eligible person in Japan. Foreigners and their household members who meet the requirements are also included.

The official website for the Special Cash Payment program is at [kyufukin.soumu.go.jp](https://kyufukin.soumu.go.jp/ja-JP/).  

The Japanese government also provided a [Guide to Special Cash Payments](https://kyufukin.soumu.go.jp/ja-JP/download/) in different languages.

## Who are eligible to receive the cash handout?

Those who are registered in the [Basic Resident Register](https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/jichi_gyousei/c-gyousei/zairyu/english/index.html) as of April 27, 2020, `including foreigners`, are eligible. There are no age restrictions, and no income requirements.

**Not Eligible**  
(*because of the Basic Resident Register rule*)

- short-term visitors
- illegally staying in Japan
- babies born after April 27, 2020

## How can I apply?

The government has set a few rules to prevent the spread of infection. Generally, the application should be made by [postal mail](#apply-by-postal-mail) or [online](#apply-online). Payments will be made to the bank account of the applicant (head of the family in the Basic Resident Register).

### Apply by Postal mail

The application form will be sent from your local municipality. You need to fill out the application form, attach a copy of your ID and bank account details, then send it back by postal mail.

If you want to see what the form looks like, there are [downloadable samples (見本)](https://kyufukin.soumu.go.jp/ja-JP/download/) at the official website.

You can apply online if you have a My Number Card, using a PC (Personal Computer) or a mobile device (smartphone, etc.). Installation of MynaPortal (マイナポータル) application is necessary, whether using a PC or a mobile device.

Make sure that you have a device that can read the My Number Card --- a [supported IC Card reader](https://img.myna.go.jp/pdf/iccardreaderwriter.pdf) connected to a PC, or your mobile device should be [one of the supported models](https://faq.myna.go.jp/faq/show/2587?category_id=3&site_domain=default) with NFC (Near Field Communications) reading capability.

## When can I apply?

The municipality where you live will decide the application period. You can check from the [市区町村の対応状況](https://kyufukin.soumu.go.jp/ja-JP/cities/) link on the official website whether your town/city has started to send the application form, or started to accept online applications.

When the online application has started and you want to apply online, you don't need to wait for the application form to arrive. The application form that you will receive by mail is not necessary for the online application.

## Important notes if you want to receive the cash relief

- You need to apply to receive the special cash payment. If you don't apply, then it means you are opting out for the cash benefit.

- There is a checkbox in the application form for each family member where you can opt NOT TO RECEIVE the payment. If you want to receive the payment, then don’t check that box.

- The application period has a deadline --- within 3 months after your local municipality has started accepting applications by mail.
